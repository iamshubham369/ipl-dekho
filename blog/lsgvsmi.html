        <p class="blog-para">The Mumbai Indians, led by Rohit Sharma, have suffered their sixth successive defeat in IPL
            2022 following their 18-run loss against Lucknow Super Giants in Match 26 of the ongoing edition. They
            closed on 181 for 9 after the LSG piled up 199 for 4, courtesy of KL Rahul's unbeaten 103 off 60 balls.

            Kieron Pollard's 14-ball 25 and Jaydev Unadkat's six-ball 14 were not enough for Mumbai Indians (MI) as they
            were beaten by 18 runs against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in Match 26 of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
            2022 at Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai. They never seemed in control after the LSG, batting first piled up 199/4
            on the board. The Rohit Sharma-led side finished on 181/4, with Suryakumar Yadav top-scoring with 37 off 27
            balls.

            Earlier in the match, the LSG rode on their skipper KL Rahul's magnificent 60-ball 103 not out to post a
            mammoth total on the scoreboard. Quinton de Kock (23 off 14 balls) and Manish Pandey (38 off 29) had given
            the support Rahul required, while Deepak Hooda's breezy eight-ball 15 helped them cross 195+ mark. For the
            MI, Jasprit Bumrah remained wicketless after his four overs but conceded just 24 runs. Jaydev Unadkat,
            Fabian Allen, and Murugan Ashwin shared four wickets.

            Following the result, the MI remained at the bottom place on the points table. The LSG, on the other hand,
            are at second, with eight points from six matches.</p>
