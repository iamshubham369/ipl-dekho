        <h1 class="blog-heading">Royal Challengers Banglore Beats Delhi Capitals by 16 runs to secure their 4th win</h1>
        <p class="blog-para">Who would've thought RCB would get to 189 when they were struggling at 92-5 but DK had
            other ideas. Along with Shahbaz Ahmed he added 97 runs as carnage was witnessed at the Wankhede. Earlier on,
            RCB slipped to 40-3 before Maxwell launched a counterattack with a 23 run-over off Kuldeep Yadav. But the
            left-arm unorthodox had his revenge by dismissing the Australian when he changed ends. DK started off his
            assault by going after Mustafizur - an over which produced 28, the 18th. The Bangladeshi pacer missed his
            lengths in that over and DK did not miss. Yet another outstanding innings from him has given RCB 20-30 more
            than they would've settled for at the halfway stage.

        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">The redemption act started by Dinesh Karthik has seen the bowlers of RCB defending a tall
            score. 190 was never easy to chase down. But Warner had other ideas as he started off on an explosive note.
            But Mitch Marsh hit a roadblock and his 24-ball 14 took out a lot of the pace from the chase. Pant played in
            a manner he knows and despite being a little lucky only managed 34. Hazlewood hit the hard lengths and
            Harshal Patel disguised the slower balls well to ensure RCB won by 16 runs. The chase was alive for a major
            part of the innings but RCB always found a way out and that was the difference between both the sides as DC
            always kept finding dead ends.</p>
        <p class="blog-para">The last four overs went for 69 and then Mitch Marsh's uncomfortable stay. In a game of
            thin margins, DC allowed RCB too much leverage. RCB are the third team to join the 8-point club .</p>
